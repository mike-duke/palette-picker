# PalettePicker

A small application that randomly generates a palette of colors and allows them to be saved to a custom backend. 

### Install and Setup

The app is hosted [here](https://palette-picker-duke.herokuapp.com)

OR, you can install the project from this repository by:

cloning it down: `git clone git@github.com:mike-duke/palette-picker.git`
installing dependencies: `npm i`
and starting the dev server: `npm start`

### The Project

This was a project for the Turing School of Software and Design. I was a student in the front end program, but this was our first project building a small server and database as well as a basic JS front end. It was built with Node, Express, and uses a PostGRES database. The app is hosted on Heroku and utilizes Travis CI for continuous integration.
