# PalettePicker

A small application that randomly generates a palette of colors and allows them to be saved to a custom backend. 

### Install and Setup

### The Project

This was a project for the Turing School of Software and Design. I was a student in the front end program, but this was our first project building a small server and database as well as a basic JS front end. The app is hosted on Heroku and utilizes Travis CI for continuous integration.
